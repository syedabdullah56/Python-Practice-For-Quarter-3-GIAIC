# 01_Intro_to_Python
#Python is an interpreted language it is executed line by line in machine code.

#How it works:

# Step-by-Step Execution of Python Code
# Writing the Python Code
# You write a .py file containing Python code.

# Lexical Analysis (Tokenizer)
# The Python interpreter breaks the code into tokens (keywords, variables, operators, etc.).

# Parsing (Syntax Analysis)
# The tokens are checked for syntax correctness and converted into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

# Compilation to Bytecode
# The AST is compiled into bytecode (.pyc file in __pycache__), which is an intermediate representation.

# Execution by Python Virtual Machine (PVM)
# The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) reads the bytecode and executes it by interacting with the system's hardware (CPU, Memory).

# Machine Code Execution
# Finally, the systemâ€™s hardware runs the instructions, producing the desired output.
#   .py file ===>  Tokenizer(Lexical)  ===> Parser(AST)  ===> Bytecode Compilation ===> Machine Code  ===> Final Output
